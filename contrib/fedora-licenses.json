            "text": "Nmap Public Source License Version 0.92\nFor more information on this license, see https://nmap.org/npsl/\n\n0. Preamble\n\nThe intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and change\nthe software regulated by this license under the open source model. It\nalso includes a Contributor Agreement and disclaims any warranty on\nCovered Software. Proprietary software companies wishing to use or\nincorporate Covered Software within their programs must contact\nLicensor to purchase a separate license. Open source developers who\nwish to incorporate parts of Covered Software into free software with\nconflicting licenses may write Licensor to request a waiver of terms.\n\nIf the Nmap Project (directly or through one of {{it's|its}} commercial\nlicensing customers) has granted you additional rights to Nmap or Nmap\nOEM, those additional rights take precedence where they conflict with\nthe terms of this license agreement.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\nmatter hereof. It contains the license terms themselves, but not the\nreasoning behind them or detailed explanations. For further\ninformation about this License, see https://nmap.org/npsl/ . That page\nmakes a good faith attempt to explain this License, but it does not\nand can not modify its governing terms in any way.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n* \"Contribution\" means any work of authorship, including the original\n  version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work\n  or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to\n  Licensor by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity\n  authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the\n  purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of\n  electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or\n  its representatives, including but not limited to communication on\n  electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, web sites,\n  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n  designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a\n  Contribution.\"\n\n* \"Contributor\" means Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on\n  behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n  subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n* \"Covered Software\" means the work of authorship, whether in Source\n  or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n\n* \"Derivative Work\" or \"Collective Work\" means any work, whether in\n  Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work\n  and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or\n  other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of\n  authorship. It includes software as described in Section 3 of this\n  License.\n\n* \"Executable\" means Covered Software in any form other than Source Code.\n\n* \"Externally Deploy\" means to Deploy the Covered Software in any way\n  that may be accessed or used by anyone other than You, used to\n  provide any services to anyone other than You, or used in any way to\n  deliver any content to anyone other than You, whether the Covered\n  Software is distributed to those parties, made available as an\n  application intended for use over a computer network, or used to\n  provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than\n  You.\n\n* \"GPL\" means the GNU General Public License Version 2, as published\n  by the Free Software Foundation and provided in Exhibit A.\n\n* \"Legal Entity\" means the union of the acting entity and all other\n  entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n  \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n* \"License\" means this document, including Exhibits.\n\n* \"Licensor\" means Insecure.Com LLC and its successors and assigns.\n\n* \"Main License Body\" means all of the terms of this document,\n  excluding Exhibits.\n\n* \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising\n  permissions granted by this License.\n\n2. General Terms\n\nCovered Software is licensed to you under the terms of the GPL\n(Exhibit A), with all the exceptions, clarifications, and additions\nnoted in this Main License Body. Where the terms in this Main License\nBody conflict in any way with the GPL, the Main License Body terms\nshall take precedence. These additional terms mean that You may not\ndistribute Covered Software or Derivative Works under plain GPL terms\nwithout special permission from Licensor.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License. However, nothing else\ngrants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute the software\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or\ndistributing the software (or any work based on the software), You\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\nand conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by\nclicking the Accept button or downloading the software.\n\n3. Derivative Works\n\nThis License (including the GPL portion) places important restrictions\non derived works. Licensor interprets that term quite broadly. To\navoid any misunderstandings, we consider software to constitute a\n\"derivative work\" of Covered Software for the purposes of this license\nif it does any of the following:\n\n* Integrates source code from Covered Software\n\n* Reads or includes Covered Software data files, such as nmap-os-db or\n  nmap-service-probes.\n\n* Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the\n  results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which\n  will execute anything you tell them to).\n\n* Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer. The\n  installers produced by InstallShield are an example of\n  this. Including Nmap with other software in compressed or archival\n  form does not trigger this provision, provided appropriate open\n  source decompression or de-archiving software is widely available\n  for no charge. For the purposes of this license, an installer is\n  considered to include Covered Software even if it actually retrieves\n  a copy of Covered Software from another source during runtime (such\n  as by downloading it from the Internet).\n\n* Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the\n  above\n\n* Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.\n  This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify Licensor's\n  intentions with some common examples. Distribution of any works\n  which meet these criteria must be under the terms of this license\n  (including this Main License Body and GPL), with no additional\n  conditions or restrictions. They must abide by all restrictions that\n  the GPL places on derivative or collective works, including the\n  requirements for distributing their source code and allowing\n  royalty-free redistribution.\n\n4. Contributor Agreement (Grant of Copyright and Patent Licenses)\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to Licensor a perpetual, worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license\nto reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly\nperform, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and such\nDerivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to You and Licensor a perpetual,\nworldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except\nas stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,\noffer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where\nsuch license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such\nContributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)\nalone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to\nwhich such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent\nlitigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim\nin a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated\nwithin the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this\nLicense for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation\nis filed.\n\nContributors may impose different terms on their Contributions by\nstating those terms in writing at the time the Contribution is\nmade. Contributors may withhold all authority from Licensor to\nincorporate submissions by conspicuously marking or otherwise\ndesignating them in writing as \"Not a Contribution\" at the time they\nmake the work available.\n\n5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\nprovides the Covered Software (and each Contributor provides its\nContributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\nOF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\nany warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\nMERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using or\nredistributing the Covered Software and assume any risks associated\nwith Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\nIn no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in\nwriting, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including\nany direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of\nany character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or\ninability to use the Covered Software (including but not limited to\ndamages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\nmalfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even\nif such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n6. External Deployment\n\nIf You Externally Deploy Covered Software, such as hosting a website\ndesigned to execute Nmap scans for users, the system and its\ndocumentation must, if technically feasible, prominently display a\nnotice stating that the system uses the Nmap Security Scanner to\nperform its tasks. If technically feasible, the notice must contain a\nhyperlink to https://nmap.org/ or provide that URL in the text.\n\n7. Trademarks\n\nThis License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\ntrademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as\nrequired for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of\nthe Covered Software.\n\n8. Termination for Patent Action\n\nThis License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer\nexercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the\ndate You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Covered Software\ninfringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an\naction alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Covered\nSoftware with other software or hardware.\n\n9. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law\n\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of Washington and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America,\nexcluding the jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any\nlitigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor\nrelating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal\njurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within\nthat District with respect to this License. The application of the\nUnited Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of\nGoods is expressly excluded.\n\n10. Npcap and the Official Nmap Windows Builds\n\nThe official Windows Nmap builds includes the Npcap driver and library\n(https://npcap.org) for packet capture and transmission on\nWindows. That software is under its own separate license terms rather\nthan this license. Therefore anyone wishing to use or redistribute\nboth pieces of software must comply with both licenses. Since Npcap\ndoes not allow for redistribution without special permission, the\nofficial Nmap Windows builds which include Npcap may not be\nredistributed without special permission. Such permission can be\nrequested by email to sales@nmap.com.\n\n11. Permission to link with OpenSSL\n\nLicensor grants permission to link Covered Software with any version\nof the OpenSSL library from OpenSSL.Org, and distribute linked\ncombinations including the two (assuming such distribution is\notherwise allowed by this agreement). You must obey this License in\nall respects for all code used other than OpenSSL.\n\n12. Waiver; Construction\n\nFailure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of\nthis License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that\nor any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the\nlanguage of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not\napply to this License.\n\n13. Enforceability\n\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nExhibit A. The GNU General Public License Version 2\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  \n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\non the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\nall.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\nthereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\nunder the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\nrun, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\nin the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\nno warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\nusers may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling\nthe user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\nannouncement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\nan announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\nto give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of\nphysically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\ncopy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\nterms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\nsoftware interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\nonly for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\nprogram in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\naccord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n[For brevity, we've cut out the GPL's final section on \"How to Apply\nTehse Terms to Your New Program\", but you can find that at\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html#SEC4 ]"

For the purposes of this definition,\n  \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n* \"License\" means this document, including Exhibits.\n\n* \"Licensor\" means Nmap Software LLC and its successors and assigns.\n\n* \"Main License Body\" means all of the terms of this document,\n  excluding Exhibits.\n\n* \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising\n  permissions granted by this License.\n\n2. General Terms\n\nCovered Software is licensed to you under the terms of the GPL\n(Exhibit A), with all the exceptions, clarifications, and additions\nnoted in this Main License Body. Where the terms in this Main License\nBody conflict in any way with the GPL, the Main License Body terms\nshall take precedence. These additional terms mean that You may not\ndistribute Covered Software or Derivative Works under plain GPL terms\nwithout special permission from Licensor.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License. However, nothing else\ngrants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute the software\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or\ndistributing the software (or any work based on the software), You\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\nand conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by\nclicking the Accept button or downloading the software.\n\n3. Derivative Works\n\nThis License (including the GPL portion) places important restrictions\non derived works. Licensor interprets that term quite broadly. To\navoid any misunderstandings, we consider software to constitute a\n\"derivative work\" of Covered Software for the purposes of this license\nif it does any of the following:\n\n* Integrates source code from Covered Software\n\n* Reads or includes Covered Software data files, such as nmap-os-db or\n  nmap-service-probes.\n\n* Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the\n  results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which\n  will execute anything you tell them to).\n\n* Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer. The\n  installers produced by InstallShield are an example of\n  this. Including Nmap with other software in compressed or archival\n  form does not trigger this provision, provided appropriate open\n  source decompression or de-archiving software is widely available\n  for no charge. For the purposes of this license, an installer is\n  considered to include Covered Software even if it actually retrieves\n  a copy of Covered Software from another source during runtime (such\n  as by downloading it from the Internet).\n\n* Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the\n  above\n\n* Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.\n\n\nThis list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify Licensor's\nintentions with some common examples. Distribution of any works which\nmeet these criteria (and that also choose to accept this license to\nbenefit from the rights granted herein) must be under the terms of\nthis license (including this Main License Body and GPL), with no\nadditional conditions or restrictions. They must abide by all\nrestrictions that the GPL places on derivative or collective works,\nincluding the requirements for distributing their source code and\nallowing royalty-free redistribution.\n\nLicensor does not purport to control through this license any software\nwhich does not require the rights granted herein (such as rights to\nredistribute and/or incorporate Covered Software executables and\nsource code). In particular, many software packages include the\nability to parse Covered Software results provided by an end user or\nto execute Covered Software that end user may have already installed\non their system. To the extent that copyright doctrines such as fair\nuse allow their practices without the need to exercise any rights\ngranted by this license, vendors and distributors of such software are\nnot bound by our definition of derivative works or any other clauses\nin this license.\n\n4. Contributor Agreement (Grant of Copyright and Patent Licenses)\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to Licensor a perpetual, worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license\nto reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly\nperform, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and such\nDerivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to You and Licensor a perpetual,\nworldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except\nas stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,\noffer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where\nsuch license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such\nContributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)\nalone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to\nwhich such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent\nlitigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim\nin a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated\nwithin the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this\nLicense for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation\nis filed.\n\nContributors may impose different terms on their Contributions by\nstating those terms in writing at the time the Contribution is\nmade. Contributors may withhold all authority from Licensor to\nincorporate submissions by conspicuously marking or otherwise\ndesignating them in writing as \"Not a Contribution\" at the time they\nmake the work available.\n\n5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\nprovides the Covered Software (and each Contributor provides its\nContributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\nOF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\nany warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\nMERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using or\nredistributing the Covered Software and assume any risks associated\nwith Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\nIn no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in\nwriting, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including\nany direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of\nany character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or\ninability to use the Covered Software (including but not limited to\ndamages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\nmalfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even\nif such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n6. External Deployment\n\nIf You Externally Deploy Covered Software, such as hosting a website\ndesigned to execute Nmap scans for users, the system and its\ndocumentation must, if technically feasible, prominently display a\nnotice stating that the system uses the Nmap Security Scanner to\nperform its tasks. If technically feasible, the notice must contain a\nhyperlink to https://nmap.org/ or provide that URL in the text.\n\n7. Trademarks\n\nThis License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\ntrademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as\nrequired for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of\nthe Covered Software.\n\n8. Termination for Patent Action\n\nThis License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer\nexercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the\ndate You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Covered Software\ninfringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an\naction alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Covered\nSoftware with other software or hardware.\n\n9. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law\n\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of Washington and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America,\nexcluding the jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any\nlitigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor\nrelating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal\njurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within\nthat District with respect to this License. The application of the\nUnited Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of\nGoods is expressly excluded.\n\n10. Npcap and the Official Nmap Windows Builds\n\nThe official Windows Nmap builds includes the Npcap driver and library\n(https://npcap.com) for packet capture and transmission on\nWindows. That software is under its own separate license terms rather\nthan this license. Therefore anyone wishing to use or redistribute\nboth pieces of software must comply with both licenses. Since Npcap\ndoes not allow for redistribution without special permission, the\nofficial Nmap Windows builds which include Npcap may not be\nredistributed without special permission. Such permission can be\nrequested by email to sales@nmap.com.\n\n11. Permission to link with OpenSSL\n\nLicensor grants permission to link Covered Software with any version\nof the OpenSSL library from OpenSSL.Org, and distribute linked\ncombinations including the two (assuming such distribution is\notherwise allowed by this agreement). You must obey this License in\nall respects for all code used other than OpenSSL.\n\n12. Waiver; Construction\n\nFailure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of\nthis License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that\nor any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the\nlanguage of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not\napply to this License.\n\n13. Enforceability\n\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nExhibit A. The GNU General Public License Version 2\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  \n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\non the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\nall.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\nthereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\nunder the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\nrun, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\nin the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\nno warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\nusers may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling\nthe user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\nannouncement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\nan announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\nto give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of\nphysically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\ncopy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\nterms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\nsoftware interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\nonly for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\nprogram in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\naccord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n[For brevity, we've cut out the GPL's final section on \"How to Apply\nThese Terms to Your New Program\", but you can find that at\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html#SEC4 ]"

Open source\ndevelopers who wish to incorporate parts of Covered Software into free\nsoftware with conflicting licenses may write Licensor to request a\nwaiver of terms.\n\nIf the Nmap Project (directly or through one of its commercial\nlicensing customers) has granted you additional rights to Nmap or Nmap\nOEM, those additional rights take precedence where they conflict with\nthe terms of this license agreement.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\nmatter hereof. It contains the license terms themselves, but not the\nreasoning behind them or detailed explanations. For further\ninformation about this License, see https://nmap.org/npsl/ . That page\nmakes a good faith attempt to explain this License, but it does not\nand can not modify its governing terms in any way.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n* \"Contribution\" means any work of authorship, including the original\n  version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work\n  or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to\n  Licensor by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity\n  authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the\n  purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of\n  electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or\n  its representatives, including but not limited to communication on\n  electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, web sites,\n  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n  designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a\n  Contribution.\"\n\n* \"Contributor\" means Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on\n  behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n  subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n* \"Covered Software\" means the work of authorship, whether in Source\n  or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n\n* \"Derivative Work\" or \"Collective Work\" means any work, whether in\n  Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work\n  and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or\n  other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of\n  authorship. It includes software as described in Section 3 of this\n  License.\n\n* \"Executable\" means Covered Software in any form other than Source Code.\n\n* \"Externally Deploy\" means to Deploy the Covered Software in any way\n  that may be accessed or used by anyone other than You, used to\n  provide any services to anyone other than You, or used in any way to\n  deliver any content to anyone other than You, whether the Covered\n  Software is distributed to those parties, made available as an\n  application intended for use over a computer network, or used to\n  provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than\n  You.\n\n* \"GPL\" means the GNU General Public License Version 2, as published\n  by the Free Software Foundation and provided in Exhibit A.\n\n* \"Legal Entity\" means the union of the acting entity and all other\n  entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n  \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n* \"License\" means this document, including Exhibits.\n\n* \"Licensor\" means {{Nmap Software|Insecure.Com}} LLC and its successors and assigns.\n\n* \"Main License Body\" means all of the terms of this document,\n  excluding Exhibits.\n\n* \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising\n  permissions granted by this License.\n\n2. General Terms\n\nCovered Software is licensed to you under the terms of the GPL\n(Exhibit A), with all the exceptions, clarifications, and additions\nnoted in this Main License Body. Where the terms in this Main License\nBody conflict in any way with the GPL, the Main License Body terms\nshall take precedence. These additional terms mean that You may not\ndistribute Covered Software or Derivative Works under plain GPL terms\nwithout special permission from Licensor.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License. However, nothing else\ngrants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute the software\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or\ndistributing the software (or any work based on the software), You\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\nand conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by\nclicking the Accept button or downloading the software.\n\n3. Derivative Works\n\nThis License (including the GPL portion) places important restrictions\non derived works. Licensor interprets that term quite broadly. To\navoid any misunderstandings, we consider software to constitute a\n\"derivative work\" of Covered Software for the purposes of this license\nif it does any of the following:\n\n* Integrates source code from Covered Software\n\n* Reads or includes Covered Software data files, such as nmap-os-db or\n  nmap-service-probes.\n\n* Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the\n  results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which\n  will execute anything you tell them to).\n\n* Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer. The\n  installers produced by InstallShield are an example of\n  this. Including Nmap with other software in compressed or archival\n  form does not trigger this provision, provided appropriate open\n  source decompression or de-archiving software is widely available\n  for no charge. For the purposes of this license, an installer is\n  considered to include Covered Software even if it actually retrieves\n  a copy of Covered Software from another source during runtime (such\n  as by downloading it from the Internet).\n\n* Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the\n  above\n\n* Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.\n  This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify Licensor's\n  intentions with some common examples. Distribution of any works\n  which meet these criteria must be under the terms of this license\n  (including this Main License Body and GPL), with no additional\n  conditions or restrictions. They must abide by all restrictions that\n  the GPL places on derivative or collective works, including the\n  requirements for distributing their source code and allowing\n  royalty-free redistribution.\n\n4. Contributor Agreement (Grant of Copyright and Patent Licenses)\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to Licensor a perpetual, worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license\nto reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly\nperform, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and such\nDerivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to You and Licensor a perpetual,\nworldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except\nas stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,\noffer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where\nsuch license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such\nContributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)\nalone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to\nwhich such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent\nlitigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim\nin a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated\nwithin the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this\nLicense for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation\nis filed.\n\nContributors may impose different terms on their Contributions by\nstating those terms in writing at the time the Contribution is\nmade. Contributors may withhold all authority from Licensor to\nincorporate submissions by conspicuously marking or otherwise\ndesignating them in writing as \"Not a Contribution\" at the time they\nmake the work available.\n\n5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\nprovides the Covered Software (and each Contributor provides its\nContributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\nOF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\nany warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\nMERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using or\nredistributing the Covered Software and assume any risks associated\nwith Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\nIn no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in\nwriting, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including\nany direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of\nany character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or\ninability to use the Covered Software (including but not limited to\ndamages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\nmalfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even\nif such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n6. External Deployment\n\nIf You Externally Deploy Covered Software, such as hosting a website\ndesigned to execute Nmap scans for users, the system and its\ndocumentation must, if technically feasible, prominently display a\nnotice stating that the system uses the Nmap Security Scanner to\nperform its tasks. If technically feasible, the notice must contain a\nhyperlink to https://nmap.org/ or provide that URL in the text.\n\n7. Trademarks\n\nThis License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\ntrademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as\nrequired for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of\nthe Covered Software.\n\n8. Termination for Patent Action\n\nThis License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer\nexercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the\ndate You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Covered Software\ninfringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an\naction alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Covered\nSoftware with other software or hardware.\n\n9. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law\n\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of Washington and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America,\nexcluding the jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any\nlitigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor\nrelating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal\njurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within\nthat District with respect to this License. The application of the\nUnited Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of\nGoods is expressly excluded.\n\n10. Npcap and the Official Nmap Windows Builds\n\nThe official Windows Nmap builds includes the Npcap driver and library\n({{https://npcap.com|https://npcap.org}}) for packet capture and transmission on\nWindows. That software is under its own separate license terms rather\nthan this license. Therefore anyone wishing to use or redistribute\nboth pieces of software must comply with both licenses. Since Npcap\ndoes not allow for redistribution without special permission, the\nofficial Nmap Windows builds which include Npcap may not be\nredistributed without special permission. Such permission can be\nrequested by email to sales@nmap.com.\n\n11. Permission to link with OpenSSL\n\nLicensor grants permission to link Covered Software with any version\nof the OpenSSL library from OpenSSL.Org, and distribute linked\ncombinations including the two (assuming such distribution is\notherwise allowed by this agreement). You must obey this License in\nall respects for all code used other than OpenSSL.\n\n12. Waiver; Construction\n\nFailure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of\nthis License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that\nor any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the\nlanguage of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not\napply to this License.\n\n13. Enforceability\n\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nExhibit A. The GNU General Public License Version 2\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  \n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\non the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\nall.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\nthereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\nunder the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\nrun, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\nin the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\nno warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\nusers may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling\nthe user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\nannouncement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\nan announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\nto give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of\nphysically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\ncopy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\nterms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\nsoftware interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\nonly for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\nprogram in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\naccord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n[For brevity, we've cut out the GPL's final section on \"How to Apply\n{{These|Tehse}} Terms to Your New Program\", but you can find that at\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html#SEC4 ]"

By downloading icons from GLYPHICONS.com you agree to be bound by the terms of this license terms.\n\nThe license is non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable and it is always tied with one email address, unique order ID (you may find this number in your first email with download link) and the name of the customer.\n\nCustomer can be either a natural person (individual human being) or a legal person (company/business).\n\nThis license is intended only for end customers; therefore you cannot purchase icons on behalf of someone else. GLYPHICONS.com does not cooperate with any resellers, each customer have to buy license directly.\n\nWhat is allowed\nYou may use icons in personal or commercial projects, repeatedly and you do not need to buy an extra license for every new project.\n\nEvery customer can lend icons to officially contracted employees during the time they work in your company, but you are fully responsible for how they are being used.\n\nThe price includes future updates of the product, which means that no additional purchase is required and you will receive new updates automatically in your mailbox as soon, as the new version is available.\n\nYou do not have to indicate the name of the author or giving any credits to GLYPHICONS.com, although it is always appreciated.\n\nWhat is not allowed\nYou cannot use icons in any product intended for further processing or where your customer is not a final owner. It is strictly prohibited to bundle icons in any HTML themes, frameworks, as a library of shapes/images or wherever icons would generate a significant value of the final product.\n\nAlso, it isn\u2019t possible to use them on a product where the icons would be used repeatedly in larger series. For example as prints of t-shirts, mugs, posters or any other product which have a character of repeated production.\n\nIt is not allowed to resell the icons (license) as such, because the icons remain the intellectual property of the author.\n\nAny other use must be approved in writing. It is not possible to request any changes in this license before or after the purchase.\n\nIf customer violates any terms and conditions in this license, it will terminate this license automatically.\n\nAll icons are provided \"as they are\" without a warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.

            "text": "COREMARK\u00ae-PRO ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT \n\nThis ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is offered by Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium, a California nonprofit corporation (\u201cLicensor\u201d), to users of its CoreMark\u00ae-PRO software (\u201cLicensee\u201d) exclusively on the following terms.\n\nLicensor offers benchmarking software (\u201cSoftware\u201d) pursuant to an open source license, but carefully controls use of its benchmarks and their associated goodwill. Licensor has registered its trademark in one of the benchmarks available through the Software, COREMARK-PRO, Ser. No. 85/487,290; Reg. No. 4,179,307 (the \u201cTrademark\u201d), and promotes the use of a standard metric as a benchmark for assessing the performance of embedded systems. Solely on the terms described herein, Licensee may use and display the Trademark in connection with the generation of data regarding measurement and analysis of computer and embedded system benchmarking via the Software (the \u201cLicensed Use\u201d).\n\n## Article 1 \u2013 License Grant.\n1.1.\tLicense. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free, revocable right and license to use and display the Trademark during the term of this Agreement (the \u201cTerm\u201d), solely and exclusively in connection with the Licensed Use. During the Term, Licensee (i) shall not modify or otherwise create derivative works of the Trademark, and (ii) may use the Trademark only to the extent permitted under this License. Neither Licensee nor any affiliate or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Trademark without the prior express written consent of Licensor, which may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of Licensor.\n\n1.2.\tModifications to the Software.  Licensee shall not use the Trademark in connection with any use of a modified, derivative, or otherwise altered copy of the Software.\n\n1.3.\tLicensor\u2019s Use. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Licensor or any of its successors or assigns from using or permitting other entities to use the Trademark, whether or not such entity directly or indirectly competes or conflicts with Licensee\u2019s Licensed Use in any manner. \n\n1.4.\tTerm and Termination.  This Agreement is perpetual unless terminated by either of the parties.  Licensee may terminate this Agreement for convenience, without cause or liability, for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, upon ten (10) business days written notice. Licensor may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon notice of breach.  Upon termination, Licensee shall immediately remove all implementations of the Trademark from the Licensed Use, and delete all digitals files and records of all materials related to the Trademark. \n\n## Article 2 \u2013 Ownership.\n2.1.\tOwnership. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor is the owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the Trademark, and all such right, title, and interest shall remain with Licensor. Licensee shall not contest, dispute, challenge, oppose, or seek to cancel Licensor\u2019s right, title, and interest in and to the Trademark. Licensee shall not prosecute any application for registration of the Trademark. Licensee shall display appropriate notices regarding ownership of the Trademark in connection with the Licensed Use.\n\n2.2.\tGoodwill. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee shall not acquire any right, title, or interest in the Trademark by virtue of this Agreement other than the license granted hereunder, and disclaims any such right, title, interest, or ownership. All goodwill and reputation generated by Licensee\u2019s use of the Trademark shall inure to the exclusive benefit of Licensor. Licensee shall not by any act or omission use the Trademark in any manner that disparages or reflects adversely on Licensor or its Licensed Use or reputation. Licensee shall not take any action that would interfere with or prejudice Licensor\u2019s ownership or registration of the Trademark, the validity of the Trademark or the validity of the license granted by this Agreement. If Licensor determines and notifies Licensee that any act taken in connection with the Licensed Use (i) is inaccurate, unlawful or offensive to good taste; (ii) fails to provide for proper trademark notices, or (iii) otherwise violates Licensee\u2019s obligations under this Agreement, the license granted under this Agreement shall terminate. \n\n## Article 3 \u2013 Indemnification. \n3.1.\tIndemnification Generally.  Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless (collectively \u201cindemnify\u201d or \u201cindemnification\u201d) Licensor, including Licensor\u2019s members, managers, officers, and employees (collectively \u201cRelated Persons\u201d), from and against, and pay or reimburse Licensor and such Related Persons for, any and all third-party actions, claims, demands, proceedings, investigations, inquiries (collectively, \u201cClaims\u201d), and any and all liabilities, obligations, fines, deficiencies, costs, expenses, royalties, losses, and damages (including reasonable outside counsel fees and expenses) associated with such Claims, to the extent that such Claim arises out of (i) Licensee\u2019s material breach of this Agreement, or (ii) any allegation(s) that Licensee\u2019s actions infringe or violate any third-party intellectual property right, including without limitation, any U.S. copyright, patent, or trademark, or are otherwise found to be tortious or criminal (whether or not such indemnified person is a named party in a legal proceeding).  \n\n3.2.\tNotice and Defense of Claims. Licensor shall promptly notify Licensee of any Claim for which indemnification is sought, following actual knowledge of such Claim, provided however that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve Licensee of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that Licensee is materially prejudiced by such failure. In the event that any third-party Claim is brought, Licensee shall have the right and option to undertake and control the defense of such action with counsel of its choice, provided however that (i) Licensor at its own expense may participate and appear on an equal footing with Licensee in the defense of any such Claim, (ii) Licensor may undertake and control such defense in the event of the material failure of Licensee to undertake and control the same; and (iii) the defense of any Claim relating to the intellectual property rights of Licensor or its licensors and any related counterclaims shall be solely controlled by Licensor with counsel of its choice. Licensee shall not consent to judgment or concede or settle or compromise any Claim without the prior written approval of Licensor (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such concession or settlement or compromise includes a full and unconditional release of Licensor and any applicable Related Persons from all liabilities in respect of such Claim.\n\n## Article 4 \u2013 Miscellaneous.\n\n4.1. Publication of Results. A \"Commercial COREMARK-PRO License\" from EEMBC is required for Licensee to disclose, reference, or publish test results generated by COREMARK-PRO in Licensee\u2019s marketing of any of Licensee\u2019s commercially\u2010available, product\u2010related materials, including, but not limited to product briefs, website, product brochures, product datasheets, or any white paper or article made available for public consumption.\n\n4.2.\tRelationship of the Parties. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties. \n\n4.3.\tNo Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for the rights of Related Persons under Article 3 (Indemnification), there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.\n\n4.4.\tAssignment. Licensee\u2019s rights hereunder are non-assignable, and may not be sublicensed. \n\n4.5.\tEquitable Relief. Licensee acknowledges that the remedies available at law for any breach of this Agreement will, by their nature, be inadequate.  Accordingly, Licensor may obtain injunctive relief or other equitable relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or to specifically enforce this Agreement, without proving that any monetary damages have been sustained, and without the requirement of posting of a bond prior to obtaining such equitable relief.\n\n4.6.\tGoverning Law. This Agreement will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to its conflict of law principles. \n\n4.7.\tAttorneys\u2019 Fees.  If any legal action, arbitration or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other reasonable costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.\n\n4.8.\tAmendment; Waiver.  This Agreement may not be amended, nor may any rights under it be waived, except in writing by Licensor.\n\n4.9.\tSeverability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent \npermitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.\n\n4.9.\tEntire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter."

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           SPECIAL EXCEPTION GRANTED BY COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n\nAs a special exception, copyright holders give you permission to link this\nlibrary with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of\nthe license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute\nthe resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also\nmeet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of\nthe license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not\nderived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you must\nextend this exception to your version of the library.\n\nNote: this exception relieves you of any obligations under sections 4 and 5\nof this license, and section 6 of the GNU General Public License."

It is not clear whether these statement are best viewed as a GPL exception (in the orthodox GPL community sense of an additional permission) or as an alternative non-GPL license.\n\nRegardless of whether these statements are seen as a GPL exception or as an alternative license, they should be classified as \"not-allowed\" for Fedora. However, given the clarifications made by the UPX maintainers, UPX is permitted to be packaged in Fedora under GPLv2-or-later. The spec file license tag (assuming no other pertinent licensing information applies) should be \"GPL-2.0-or-later\".\n\nThe equivalent TOML file LicenseRef-GPL-2.0-or-later_WITH_UPX.toml (with status \"not-allowed\") is also being added to the TOML file directory since some may prefer to view this as a GPL exception for Fedora classification purposes. \n\nThis TOML file contains most of the contents of the LICENSE file (some material at the beginning and end is not relevant and has not been copied).",

The\n   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n\n   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n\n   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n      distributed by us.\n   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n\n\nANNOTATIONS\n===========\n\n  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n\n  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n    by definition.\n\n  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project."

You may also obtain a copy of the AGPL (or LGPL) by writing\nto: Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\n02110-1301 USA\n\n\n                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."

For example, we consider an application to constitute a        *\n * derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the   *\n * following with any software or content covered by this license          *\n * (\"Covered Software\"):                                                   *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Reads or includes copyrighted data files, such as Nmap's nmap-os-db   *\n * or nmap-service-probes.                                                 *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    *\n * results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will *\n * execute anything you tell them to).                                     *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The *\n * installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including *\n * Nmap with other software in compressed or archival form does not        *\n * trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  *\n * or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    *\n * purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered *\n * Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  *\n * another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       *\n * Internet).                                                              *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the  *\n * above.                                                                  *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.  *\n *                                                                         *\n * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *\n * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *\n * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *\n * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *\n * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *\n * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *\n * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *\n *                                                                         *\n * As another special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants  *\n * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *\n * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *\n * listed in the included docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute   *\n * linked combinations including the two.                                  *\n *                                                                         *\n * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *\n * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *\n * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *\n * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *\n * allowed.  All GPL references to \"this License\", are to be treated as    *\n * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *\n *                                                                         *\n * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *\n * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *\n * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *\n * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *\n * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *\n * Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source        *\n * software.  Please contact fyodor@nmap.org with any such requests.       *\n * Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source software into  *\n * Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders. *\n *                                                                         *\n * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *\n * Nmap in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also    *\n * offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary            *\n * applications and appliances.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\nto guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure\nthe software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies\nto most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program\nwhose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation\nsoftware is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You\ncan apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\nwish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you\ncan change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or\nfor a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If\nthe software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its\nrecipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any\nproblems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\nreputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be\nlicensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\nof this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such\nprogram or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program\nor any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\ntranslation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\nby this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program\nis not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been\nmade by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the\nProgram does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of\nthe Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\nmay at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n   * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n     that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n   * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n     under the terms of this License.\n\n   * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n     in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\n     an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty\n     (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may\n     redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user\n     how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself\n     is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your\n     work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be\nreasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\nthis License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\ndistribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections\nas part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of\nthe whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\nlicensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\nregardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\nthe right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\nbased on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\nthe Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage\nor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\n     above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\n     to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of\n     physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\n     copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\n     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\n     software interchange; or,\n\n   * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only\n     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n     Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source\ncode distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\neither source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\nand so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\ncomponent itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to\ncopy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,\neven though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\nthe object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\nit. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nProgram or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\nProgram (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms\nand conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so\nas to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\nother pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute\nthe Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies\ndirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both\nit and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\nProgram.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\nor other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;\nthis section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free\nsoftware distribution system, which is implemented by public license\npractices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\nsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\napplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\nshe is willing to distribute software through any other system and a\nlicensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so\nthat distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\nbody of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make\nexceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO\nTHE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM\nPROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\nLOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR\nTHIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\nuse to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\nwhich everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\nexclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\"\nline and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) 19yy  name of author\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when\nit starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\nfor details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\n(which makes passes at compilers) written\nby James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\nTy Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead of this License."

Feel free to play it all you want and share it with friends, but for the moment I'd like to just have a central backup place (here) for the game.  In the future I might not mind other sites sharing it, but I do enjoy amusing fans. :)"

Based on some changes made by the maintainers:\nhttps://github.com/upx/upx/commit/295889023fdf2818b381deb779fe21452cf2988d#diff-2b7814d3fca2e99e56c51b6ff2aa313ea6e9da6424804240aa8ad891fdfe0900R92\nhttps://github.com/upx/upx/commit/295889023fdf2818b381deb779fe21452cf2988d#diff-8fb22d0484d91bba91b05e1435439d177c03610ec37e59097a15d4c7aeb0f086R943\nour understanding is that certain statements in this file (particularly in the \"Annotations\" section) are not interpretations of and limitations placed on GPLv2 itself but rather explanations of certain requirements embodied in the GPL exception. It is not clear whether these statement are best viewed as a GPL exception (in the orthodox GPL community sense of an additional permission) or as an alternative non-GPL license.\n\nRegardless of whether these statements are seen as a GPL exception or as an alternative license, they should be classified as \"not-allowed\" for Fedora. However, given the clarifications made by the UPX maintainers, UPX is permitted to be packaged in Fedora under GPLv2-or-later. The spec file license tag (assuming no other pertinent licensing information applies) should be \"GPL-2.0-or-later\".\n\nThe equivalent TOML file LicenseRef-UPX.toml (with status \"not-allowed\") is also being added to the TOML file directory since some may prefer to view this as a distinct license rather than as a GPL exception for Fedora classification purposes. \n\nThis TOML file contains most of the contents of the LICENSE file (some material at the beginning and end is not relevant and has not been copied).\n\nWe should change the SPDX expression if SPDX adds the 'ExpressionRef' construct permitting user-defined exceptions to something like 'GPL-2.0-or-later WITH ExceptionRef-UPX'.",

The\n   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n\n   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n\n   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n      distributed by us.\n   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n\n\nANNOTATIONS\n===========\n\n  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n\n  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n    by definition.\n\n  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project."
