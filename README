This is a `port' of Virtual Richard Matthew Stallman to pacman-based
distributions such as Arch Linux (also Manjaro, Endeavour, Artix, Obarun...)

It is VERY EXPERIMENTAL and NOT VERY GOOD OR RELIABLE. It could change
any minute. You have been warned

Documentation and copyright info are in the embedded POD of the
vrms-pacman.pl script, and can be read with eg. `perldoc -F vrms-pacman.pl'
-- for your comfort and convenience, a manpage I preprocessed earlier is
included in the repository. Full licence text can be found in the file `GPL'

The original vrms was a perl script on Debian, now going by
check-dsfg-status, which just isn't quite so snappy. vrms-rpm is available
for rpm-based systems (Fedora, RHEL, SuSE, Rocky...) in C, using librpm.

=== TODO ===
- Change Licences::Heuristics supplement rather than supplant the
  SPDX/Scancode databases, by preprocessing odd names and mapping them to
  proper ones. Incorporate the resultant stub into the main script
